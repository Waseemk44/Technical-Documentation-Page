## Introduction
JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.

## What you should already know
This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
- A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
- Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
- Some programming experience.

## JavaScript and Java
JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. JavaScript is very free-form compared to Java.

## Hello world
To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code.

## Variables
You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. JavaScript identifiers must conform to certain rules.

## Declaring variables
You can declare a variable in three ways: with the keyword `var`, by simply assigning it a value, or with the keyword `let`.

## Variable scope
Variables can be declared globally or locally within a function.

## Global variables
Global variables are properties of the global object. They can be accessed across different windows or frames.

## Constants
Constants are created with the `const` keyword and cannot be reassigned.

## Data types
JavaScript defines seven data types, including primitives like Boolean, null, undefined, Number, String, Symbol, and Object.

## if...else statement
Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false.

## while statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

## Function declarations
A function definition consists of the `function` keyword, followed by the function name, arguments, and statements.
